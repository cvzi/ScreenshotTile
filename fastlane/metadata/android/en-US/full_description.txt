<u>Note:</u>
🎦 When you take a screenshot, the <b>"Google Cast" icon</b> will appear in the status bar and it will be visible in the screenshot image.
If you want to hide the icon, there is an explanation here: <a href="https://github.com/cvzi/ScreenshotTile#icon">github.com/cvzi/ScreenshotTile#icon</a>

<h2>Permissions:</h2>❏ <i>android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE "Photos/Media/Files and Storage"</i>
This is required to save the screenshot files on the internal storage of your device.

❏ <i>android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE</i>
Since Android 9/Pie this permission is required to take screenshots. It basically means that this app can run without showing itself. However the app will always show a notification when it is running.

<h2>Automatic screenshots:</h2>If you want to automate screenshots from another app, e.g. MacroDroid or Tasker, you can find a step-by-step guide here:

<h2>Hiding the app icon:</h2>In the app settings you can hide the app icon from your launcher. You can still access the app by long pressing the tile in your quick settings. Unfortunately, Android 10 does not allow hiding an app anymore.
